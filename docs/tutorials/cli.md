# CLI Integration

You can play or quick game or do some pretty impressive things with the Word-Search-Generator [CLI Integration](../reference/cli.md).

Generate a puzzle.

```
$ word-search works, from, the, cli, too
```
Generate a puzzle **20 characters wide** with **difficulty level 1**.

```
$ word-search works, from, the, cli, too -l 1 -s 20
```
Generate a puzzle with **10 random dictionary words**.

```
$ word-search -r 10
```
Generate a puzzle and **save as a csv**.

```
$ word-search works, from, the, cli, too -o puzzle.csv
```
Generate a puzzle and **save as a pdf** with the solution puzzle included.

```
$ word-search works, from, the, cli, too -o ~/Desktop/puzzle.pdf -c
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è You can also use words from a file...

```
$ cat words.txt | word-search
```

This really came in handy for those kid's food menus I mentioned in the introduction. I was able to take a folder full of .txt documents with themed words and generate dozens of level 1 Word Search Puzzles at exactly 15 characters in size super fast...

```
$ for f in tools/sample_word_lists/word*.txt; do word-search "$(cat $f)" -l 1 -s 15 -o $f.pdf; done
Puzzle saved: ~/.../words-5.txt.pdf
...
Puzzle saved: ~/.../words-50.txt.pdf
```

## CLI Expert Mode

Really want to challenge yourself? Try this in the CLI. All words will be secret, just don't peek ü´£ at the key! Good luck!

```bash
$ word-search -rx 10 -l 3
